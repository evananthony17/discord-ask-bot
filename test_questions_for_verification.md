## üéØ Key Test Cases for the Original Bug

**Most Important Tests:**
- Question #1: `!ask who should I invest in caminero or Corey Seager` 
  - **Before Fix**: Would be allowed (processed as single player)
  - **After Fix**: Should be BLOCKED (multi-player intent detected)

- Question #25: `!ask how is Corey or should I bench him`
  - **Should be ALLOWED**: "bench him" is not a player name

- Question #30: `!ask Suarez update`
