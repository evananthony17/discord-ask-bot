🧪 EMERGENCY FIXES VERIFICATION TEST
Test the emergency fixes to ensure they resolve the critical system issues

This test verifies:
1. Rate limiting protection works
2. Exact match priority prevents unnecessary processing
3. Name extraction no longer produces garbage
4. Validation filters out common English words
5. API call explosion is prevented
